YEY - I'm making a game called GTR_Server. You should try it out for free. https://gtr-server.tk

I am a Game Developer that uses Unreal Engine 4 and 5. I am also a Full-Stack Web Developer, who uses Node.JS, Express.JS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I am currently learning React.JS as well.
I do also use C#, but only for Windows Applications.

I started coding at the age of 10, and I haven't stopped since. I am now 15 and finishing my GCSEs.

The GCSE subjects that I took are: English Language, Maths, Human Biology, Sociology, Psychology, and Computer Science.
